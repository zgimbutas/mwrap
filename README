MWrap
=====

MWrap is an interface generation system in the spirit of SWIG or matwrap.
From a set of augmented MATLAB script files, MWrap will generate a MEX gateway to desired C/C++/Fortran function calls and MATLAB function files to access that gateway.
It makes wrapping C/C++/Fortran from MATLAB almost pleasant!
The details of converting to and from MATLAB's data structures, and of
allocating and freeing temporary storage, are hidden from the user. It is also compatible with modern Octave via `mkoctfile --mex`.

To compile, edit `make.inc` and then run `make`.  The output will be a standalone executable (`mwrap`) in the main directory.

It was created by David Bindel, who hosts his old version
at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/sw/mwrap


Example usage
-------------

David Bindel's user's guide (`mwrap.pdf`) describes MWrap in detail; you can also look at the example subdirectories and the testing subdirectory to get some idea of how MWrap is used.

Alex Barnett also maintains a set of minimally complete tutorial examples of calling C/Fortran libraries (including OpenMP) from MATLAB/Octave, using MWrap, at https://github.com/ahbarnett/mwrapdemo
